    #When engaging in gainful activity at the reference age, it is now possible to waive the exemption.
    #This waiver allows for filling contribution gaps and, in general, improving AVS pensions up to the maximum pension.
    #The waiver is generally only meaningful until the end of the month in which the insured reaches the age of 70 (reference age + 5 years),
    #as income earned after age 70 no longer contributes to pensions.
    #The worker must inform their employer, before the first salary payment of the year or the first salary payment after reaching the reference age,
    #that they do not wish to use the exemption. Without notification, the exemption is automatically deducted.
    #The worker's choice is valid for the entire year and is automatically carried over to the following year,
    #unless the employer is notified otherwise before the first salary payment of the subsequent year.
